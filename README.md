# ðŸŒ¡ Temperature Converter (Python)

## ðŸ“‹ Description

This is a simple Python console program for converting temperatures between three scales:

- Celsius (`C`)
- Fahrenheit (`F`)
- Kelvin (`K`)

The program runs in a loop: the user selects the input temperature scale and enters a value, then the program outputs the equivalent values in the other two scales. You can exit the program by entering `Q`.
